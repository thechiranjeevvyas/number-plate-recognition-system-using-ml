# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using Machine Learning

This project is aimed at developing a system for Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to accurately detect and recognize license plates from images or video streams.

## Overview

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates to create vehicle location data. ANPR can be used to store the images captured by the cameras as well as the text from the license plate, with some configurable to store a photograph of the driver. Systems commonly use infrared lighting to allow the camera to take the picture at any time of the day.

This project aims to implement an ANPR system using machine learning algorithms to accurately detect and recognize license plates from images or video feeds.

## Features

- License plate detection from images or video streams.
- Character segmentation and recognition from detected license plates.
- Configurable options for input sources and output formats.
- Integration with existing surveillance or traffic management systems.
- Customizable training pipeline for improving recognition accuracy.
